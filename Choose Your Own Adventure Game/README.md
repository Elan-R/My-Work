To use my code,
1. Create a game in a text file (an example can be found in world_definition.txt)
2. Run Compiler.java and select the text file when prompted, then select a file to write to (a different one from the text file) (this step can be skipped if you use the example file world_definition.ser)
3. Run Game.java and select the file that you wrote to in the previous step (or choose world_definition.ser if you skipped that step)
4. Play the game in the console!
